    bible 'John 3:16-20'
    scripture '<h1>John 3:16-20</h1><h3>Chapter 3</h3><b>16</b> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <b>17</b> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <b>18</b> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <b>19</b> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <b>20</b> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.'
